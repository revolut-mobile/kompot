Kompot is a framework for building android apps. It gives you a project setup with unidirectional data flow, navigation and multi-module support from the box, letting you concentrate on what's most important - building apps that users love.

With Kompot, you don't need to bother about the right way of calling fragment transactions or building tons of intents for Activities. You call your screens directly by giving them the desired input in the constructors, and the framework will do the job of bringing your UI to the user's attention
